TODO List:

Paper:  
- [x] Abstract  
- [x] Introduction  
- [x] Literature Review  
- [x] Data Collection  
- [x] Data Preprocessing  
- [x] Methodology  
- [ ] Experiment  
- [ ] Discussion and Analysis  
- [ ] Conclusion
- [ ] Review and Final Draft Modification

Code:
- [x] Data Preprocessing
- [x] Skull segmentation (Baby Version -> small Dataset)
- [x] Unet CNN Model for segmentation(Set Up Already, not trained)
- [x] Transfer Learning for classification (Set up Already, not trained yet)
- [ ] Evaluation Metrics  (After training the model, Winter Break)

Winter Break Plan:
Train Model:
- [ ] Unet CNN Model (4 days)
- [ ] Transfer Learning (4 days)
- [ ] Evaluation Metrics (4 days)
- [ ] Paper Writing for the else (the rest of the break)
